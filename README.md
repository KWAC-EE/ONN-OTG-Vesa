Outputs are saved into a ZIP folder, which can be uploaded directly to JLCPCB or PCBWay

PDFs are for reference to schematics and internal layers of the PCB

Hub should be assembled as standard 4-layer 1.6mm FR4 PCBA

Vesa may be FR4 or Aluminum (used for mounting hub to back of monitor)

C-to-Micro adapter is used to bridge Hub to Onn TV-Box (provides both power & data)

Hub linked to Vesa plate with 4x of 2108-440-AL-7 (https://www.digikey.com/short/th37r9zm) and 8x #4-40 screws

Onn TV box affixed to Hub PCBA with 5cm x 5cm velcro strips (for soft alignment of adapter)


Requires developer mode through Onn Android-tv system -> Default USB -> Ethernet to use peripherals

Updates to Android/Google TV have nerfed expandible storage, so SD card success may vary
